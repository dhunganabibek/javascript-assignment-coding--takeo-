/*
    1. Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.
    Checks whether the input is number or not
    and returns the lower of the two number
*/

/*
    2. Define a recursive function isEven to determine whether a number is completely divisible by 2.
    The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, anegative or whole number) and return a Boolean.
*/

/*
    3. Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and 
    returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.
    Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, 
    except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that
     is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). 
     Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
